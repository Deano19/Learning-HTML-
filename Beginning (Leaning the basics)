# Here is an the beginning of how I used HTML to create my very first App.

To start off with I got an understanding of how the basic sytaxs work in HTML such as;

-Button: creates a button
-p:create a paragraph
-a href="Link": creates a hyperlink

Next was creating buttons,whilst also understanding alot more features that can transform basic buttons to unique once, 
its endless. The files below show you what buttons I have created using different syntax's, such as;

The main new sytax that I learnt (very important) is 'style', 
this sytax is the main command which will allow you to stylise your buttons, (in this example), 
next was the commands inside of the 'style' sytax.

-background-color: changes the background color inside the button
-color: changes the color of teh letters
-border: changes the thickness of the border (none basically means no border outline)
-height: height of the button
-width: width (length, from right to left) of the button
-cursor: determines what happens to the cursor once it's hovered the button (open the file to get a better undertsanding)
-margin: the gap between multiple button (individual margin commands for each direction)
-transition: creates a process (in this example changes the opacity of a period of time.
-padding: thickness of the border created around the word (individual padding commands for each direction)

As there are three seperate buttons another command is used in order to seperate the stylisation of all buttons, 
in order to so an 'element class' command is used. 

example: .join-button {stylisation commands}

'Element class' command isn't just used for seperating the sylisation commands for specific buttons,
it is also used create actions, such as:

-hover: action once the cursor hovers over the button
-active: action once button is clicked
